# Misk-Capstone: Text-Based Personality Type Classification

# By:Razan Sendi

# Objective

The primary objective of this capstone project is to utilize an amalgam of machine learning algorithms to classify individuals in accordance to their Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality type.

# Background

The Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a systematization of archetypal personality types used in clinical practice. The system is segregated into 4 binary orthogonal personality dimensions, which together formulates approximately 16 distinctive personality types.

The 4 personality dimensions are as follow:

- **Extraversion (E) vs Introversion (I)**: a measure of how much an individual prefers their outer or inner world.
- **Sensing (S) vs Intuition (N)**: a measure of how much an individual processes information through the five senses versus impressions through patterns.
- **Thinking (T) vs Feeling (F)**: a measure of preference for objective principles and facts versus weighing the emotional perspectives of others.
- **Judging (J) vs Perceiving (P):** a measure of how much an individual prefers a planned and ordered life versus a flexible and spontaneous life

Accordingly , MBTI is currently considered to be one of the most sought after and dependable methods for determining an individuals personality type.

# Value Proposition

The MBTI Personality trait model can be an extremely beneficial tool in a business setting particularly during the employment process. As such indicator can contribute towards helping companies, particularly the HR team, comprehend and further understand individuals overall motivations and occupational behaviour. Subsequently, this model can be portrayed as a way to help employees focus on utilizing their strengths and ameliorating their weaknesseses in line with their personality type.
